title: "Where's Muh Hoard"
description: "Accursed Hoard Locations"

For the Final Fantasy 14 (FF14) dungeon, Heaven On High (hoh), there's an item called the Accursed Hoard. This item has a small chance for each floor to spawn and is in a semi-random location when it does spawn. So to cut down on the time that is spent looking for the hoard, this was created to show the possible location of the hoard on a given floor. 

For example: On floor 28, the hoard might spawn in one of 3 locations. By grabbing a screenshot of each location, we can remove a large part of the guessing and go to where we might think it is.

To use: 

```
npm install
```

```
npm start
```
